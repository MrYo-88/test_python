<a href="page_depth_2.html">Page depth in SEO… what is it?</a>
In a website structure, a page’s depth is the number of clicks needed to reach that page from the homepage, using the shortest path. For instance, a page linked from the home page is at depth 1.

What is it not?
Not to be confused with the notion of page depth in Web Analytics tools, which is related to a user’s visit and the sequence of pages he saw during that visit: in that context, a page’s depth is the number of clicks after which the user reached the page.

Why should you care ?
Deep pages have a lower Pagerank (or none) and are less likely to be crawled by search engine robots. So robots are are less likely to discover them, and if they do, they are less likely to explore them again to check if they are still there and if they have changed. Of course being crawled regularly does not mean they will rank, but it’s a necessary starting point.

Bottom line, deep pages are less likely to rank.
