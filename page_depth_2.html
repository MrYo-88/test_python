 <a href="page_depth_3.html">How do you know you have a depth problem?</a>

from the ‘average depth’ indicator, in the ‚ÄòDistribution’ tab
It should ideally be between 3 and 5, depending on your website’s size and structure.
from the shape of your global depth distribution graph
A typicaldistribution by depth has a bell shape – or truncated bell if the website was not fully crawled. Ideally the bell’s shape is high and narrow, and most of the website’s volume (top of the bell) is around depth 3 to 5. If the bell is quite flattened, and / or if there is a long tail on the right, with a gentle slope, there is a depth problem.
from the Suggested Patterns for deep URLs
If a few patterns correspond to the vast majority of deep URLs (as shown in the ‚Äò% all metrics’), the problem is already identifed. You can also see a depth distribution graph for that subset of URLs: click on the suggested pattern, click on ‚ÄòExplore all URLs”, and go to the depth tab.
A few example of global depth distribution graphs that show there is a problem:
